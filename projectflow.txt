-------------------------Setting up project structure and notebook analysis---------------------------

1.  Creating GitHub repo, cloning it locally  
2.  Creating virtual environment named 'calories-ml' conda create -n calories-ml python=3.10 -y
3.  Activating the virtual environment - conda activate calories-ml 
4.  Installing packages inside venv - pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn ipykernel scikit-learn xgboost notebook
5.  Conecting new venv with Jupyter - python -m ipykernel install --user --name=calories-ml --display-name "Python (calories-ml)"
6.  Starting Jupyter notebook while inside venv - jupyter notebook
7.  Analysis in notebook inlcuding EDA, preprocessing, model training and evaluation
8.  First gid add . - commit - push 

-------------------------Setup MLFlow on Dagshub---------------------------

9.  DAagshub link: https://dagshub.com/dashboard 
10. Create > New Repo > Connect a repo > (Github) Connect > Select your repo > Connect
11. pip install dagshub & mlflow in virtual environment
12. First experiment - file called experiment1, connecting base model (xgboost) and doing few runs with changing hyperparameters (example with n_estimators change)
13. Second experiment - connecting and comparing base model vs another models and comparing results in MLFlow (we get best results for xgboost algorithm)
14. Third experiment - xgboost hyperparameters tuning to get the best model for predictions

Finishing and collecting all info in our first notebook where whole EDA started
